# Diet_Cart
Vegan Cart prototype

This app was created for hackNSUT as a part of TechWeek 2019. The name of the project was 'Diet Cart'. This app is relatively simple in
its implementation. It used Google's Firebase API to authenticate the user and retrieves the data using Cloud Firestore. The UI is smooth 
and utilizes fragments for modularity and card view for a neat and modern look and feel.
